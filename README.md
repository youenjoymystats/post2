This code is for post2 of the youenjoymystats blog.

get_cities.py uses the phish.net API to determine which cities phish has played in, the geocoordinates of those cities, and how many times they played there.

burlington_nyc.py also uses the phish.net API to determine the number of shows played in NYC and Burlington by year.

map.R creates a map of these cities using googleVis and prints the HTML. It also graphs the number of shows played by year in NYC and Burlington using ggplot2.
